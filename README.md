Prediction of Star Rating Based on Deep Learning
Because we don't read reviews often as consumers, we frequently rely on star ratings to determine whether a product is worthwhile purchasing.

So, we want to translate the text reviews provided by the users into star ratings in our project.

This helps both business owners run more effectively by encouraging other customers to purchase the good or service.

In order to uncover areas where their goods or services might be improved, business owners essentially need statistical analysis of their business.
This can be accomplished by converting the star ratings from the text reviews.
For the purpose of analysing their business, producers need to be aware of the product ratings.

Better revenue generation for their company may result from it.
